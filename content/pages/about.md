## What is Bun Blog?

**Bun Blog** is a static site generator built with [Bun](https://bun.sh/). This
means that you can add and edit content by editing local markdown files. Your
markdown files exist with your source files so they are versioned with git. By
doing `bun run index.ts` you run the build script which creates static html
files using your markdown content and settings.
